# What is this plugin?
It's a simple plugin that stores your items in a chest when you die.

# Features
- Store items on death.

Currently, there are no configuration options for the plugin, but we can add them later if there is interest in the project. The current version of the plugin was intentionally kept simple to reduce the likelihood of it breaking between different Minecraft versions.

# Setup:
- [Download](https://modrinth.com/organization/simple-plugins) the jar file.
- Place the file into your server's plugin folder.
- Start the server and Enjoy!

## Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/TrueDarkLord/DeathChests/issues) if there are problems.
